Each tweet in the file (named usnewshealth.txt) has attributes such as unique code number, time & date, url etc. To enable clustering we ill first need to remove thee excessive attributes. Also, some unique characters and
symbols are not contributing to the clustering and the meaning of the sentences so they are better to be removed.

from typing_extensions import Text
import re
import random
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Load the file
file_path = 'usnewshealth.txt'

with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Step 2: Remove tweet ID and timestamp
tweets = [line.split('|')[-1].strip() for line in lines]

# Steps 3 to 6: Further preprocessing
def preprocess_tweet(tweet):
    # Remove @mentions
    tweet = re.sub(r'@\w+', '', tweet)
    # Remove URLS
    tweet = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', tweet)
    # Remove hashtag symbols
    tweet = tweet.replace('#', '')
    # Convert to lowercase
    return tweet.lower()

# Apply the preprocessing function to each tweet
preprocessed_tweets = [preprocess_tweet(tweet) for tweet in tweets]

# Return the first 5 preprocessed tweets as a sample to check the preprocessing
preprocessed_tweets[:5]
